# Sweat-Snitch

Humidifier and Temp reader and projector, Top oled shows temp whilst bottom oled shows humidity. It also has a i2c multiplex because both oleds use the same lib.


A border of one px will show if temps are over 30 degrees C and a border of 4px will show if temps are over 40 degrees C


And no. This won't work if  you completely submerge it in water.
